It is especially important for me to take care of the first stage of planning and details to approach the project. It is important that the client can see and understand the different stages of production and the time of each stage. The first project was for a non-profit cultural association. We developed a platform to manage events, people and loyalty. After finish and persuade the admin team, I published the code under an open license in my Github in order to show a nice Kotlin App and Firebase. Of course, I would love that any association uses the platform. Another project that I would like to highlight is a tourism platform that I have developed using Flutter framework. The development of apps for Android and iOS using Flutter is amazing. I enjoyed the easy domain language every day and I save a lot of important time in development and maintenance for this type of projects. This project uses the Firebase suite as backend solution.
